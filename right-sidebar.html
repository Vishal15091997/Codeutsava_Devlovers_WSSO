										<h3>Effects of Water Scarcity</h3>
										<p>If there is no water that can be used in order to help water the crops, then you are going to have people that are going hungry. Animals will also die, which will result in a lack of meat as well. Water scarcity, in short, causes starvation to occur en masse for both people and animals that are located in the area.</p>
                                                                                <p> If you don’t have clean water access, then you will be more likely to get diseases from the water that you do have. Whether you’re drinking the water or using it for bathing, those diseases will get into the body and, in a number of cases, the people carrying those diseases will pass away.</p>
                                                                                <p> Without access to clean water, there is no way to clean food, dishes, or people. When people are not given access to proper sanitation, disease (which we talked about above) ends up becoming much more of an issue than it would have been otherwise. It also causes mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.</p>
                                                                                <p> All in all, people who are dealing with water scarcity are often stuck in poverty as well. These people are not able to get the resources that they need in order to be able to thrive, and instead are just barely surviving through these difficult times.</p>
                                                                                <h3>Solutions for Water Scarcity</h3>
										<p>There are a lot of things that we need to consider when we’re looking at water scarcity and how we can deal with it. If we start to look at this issue as a whole, and we work hard to make sure that we are able to make a difference when it comes to this widespread issue, we’re going to be in a much better place to help people all over the world in preventing this issue from getting worse.</p>

											<h3>Lack of Access to Drinking Water</h3>
											<p>The biggest problem that happens when you have water scarcity is that people are not able to get fresh, clean drinking water. The human body can only go so long without water.</p>

											<h3>Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink</h3>
											<p>In these lines, Samuel Taylor Coleridge made a prescient point: while seawater is plentiful, people can survive only with fresh water. This surprisingly scarce resource is the lynchpin sustaining human lives and healthy ecosystems across our rich biosphere: the most vital resource for life on Earth as we know it.</p>
